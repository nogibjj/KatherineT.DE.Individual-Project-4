# Individual Project 4
This project builds a publicly accessible auto-scaling container using Azure App Services and Flask. I designed a web app that returns welcoming messages and the current UTC time as a clock converter. DockerHub is used to build a container. This app runs at the public URL provided by Azure.

## Steps
1. Set up environment. Change the `requirement.txt` file to install `flask` package in GitHub CodeSpace.
2. Build a flask app. Mine is in `app.py`. This app utilizes a HTML template in templates folder.
```
